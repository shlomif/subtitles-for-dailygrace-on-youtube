1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
What's up, fuckers?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,300
Hey guys, it's Friday here on dailygrace and you know what that means?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Sex advice, sex advice, sexy advice

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,600
OK, now I've decided that one Friday of every month

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,600
is going to be dedicated to advice

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
on love, sex, relationships

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,600
and the etc. that falls in that umbrella of

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
weather cat things (?)

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,300
and we're going call this "Daily Gradvice".

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,300
I went on my Tumblr and I asked you guys what kind of advice

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,500
did you need about love and sex and relationships

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,500
and you all gave me some interesting questions

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,600
so - let's get into them.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,200
what's the best way to approach a girl or a guy?

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,900
Great question.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,800
From the front.

17
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:07,526
How do I tell a guy I made out with several times, that I would be a terrible girlfriend and don't think we should go out... help!

18
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:09,466
OK, interesting question.

19
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:13,918
First, you need to tell him that you're using him to play mouth paintball.

20
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:21,823
And then you just have to say "I really don't want to change my Facebook status."

21
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:24,874
How do you get someone to notice you as more than just a friend?

22
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:29,196
OK, good question. If you're a guy - you want to tell them something along the lines of

23
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:32,384
"I don't want to keep my dick in my pants around you

24
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:35,533
I want to keep it in your metaphorical lady pants.

25
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:39,105
Dockers. I want to dock her.

26
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:48,956
If you're a girl, you need to say "Listen, I want you to sail your dick ship into my lady port."

27
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,595
How can a man tell when a woman is flirting with him? I only ask because I seem to be completely oblivious to these things.

28
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:57,505
OK, great question.

29
00:01:57,605 --> 00:02:00,981
There's usually three signs that a girl is flirting with you:

30
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:05,568
One, she laughs unnecessarily and stupidly at your "jokes"

31
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:09,639
Something along the lines of this: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

32
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,573
Two, she makes unnecessary body contact with you.

33
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:13,863
Oh my god, what a cool watch!

34
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:17,659
Oh my gosh, your hair is... what products do you use?

35
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,287
Your face.

36
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,886
She's not blind - she's flirting.

37
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:25,776
Three, she'll probably think everything that you do is really cool when it's not cool.

38
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:28,079
Sorry.

39
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:32,120
Oh my God, that's so cool.Cool. Oh, so cool. It's like really cool.

40
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,864
You're so cool - I'm not that cool.

41
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:36,506
What? Cool! Oh, your face is so cool.

42
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:39,144
What! Oh my God! Ha, ha, ha.

43
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:40,195
Something like that.
