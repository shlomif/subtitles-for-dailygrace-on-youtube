1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
What's up, fuckers?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,300
Hey guys, it's Friday here on dailygrace and you know what that means?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Sex advice, sex advice, sexy advice

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,600
OK, now I've decided that one Friday of every month

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,600
is going to be dedicated to advice

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
on love, sex, relationships

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,600
and the etc. that falls in that umbrella of

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
weather cat things (?)

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,300
and we're going call this "Daily Gradvice".

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,300
I went on my Tumblr and I asked you guys what kind of advice

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,500
did you need about love and sex and relationships

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,500
and you all gave me some interesting questions

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,600
so - let's get into them.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,200
what's the best way to approach a girl or a guy?

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,900
Great question.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,800
From the front.

17
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:07,526
How do I tell a guy I made out with several times, that I would be a terrible girlfriend and don't think we should go out... help!

18
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:09,466
OK, interesting question.

19
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:13,918
First, you need to tell him that you're using him to play mouth paintball.

20
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:21,823
And then you just have to say "I really don't want to change my Facebook status."

21
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:24,874
How do you get someone to notice you as more than just a friend?

22
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:29,196
OK, good question. If you're a guy - you want to tell them something along the lines of

23
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:32,384
"I don't want to keep my dick in my pants around you

24
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:35,533
I want to keep it in your metaphorical lady pants.

25
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:39,105
Dockers. I want to dock her.

26
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:48,956
If you're a girl, you need to say "Listen, I want you to sail your dick ship into my lady port."

27
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,595
How can a man tell when a woman is flirting with him? I only ask because I seem to be completely oblivious to these things.

28
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:57,505
OK, great question.

29
00:01:57,605 --> 00:02:00,981
There's usually three signs that a girl is flirting with you:

30
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:05,568
One, she laughs unnecessarily and stupidly at your "jokes"

31
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:09,639
Something along the lines of this: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

32
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,573
Two, she makes unnecessary body contact with you.

33
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:13,863
Oh my god, what a cool watch!

34
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:17,659
Oh my gosh, your hair is... what products do you use?

35
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,287
Your face.

36
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,886
She's not blind - she's flirting.

37
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:25,776
Three, she'll probably think everything that you do is really cool when it's not cool.

38
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:28,079
Sorry.

39
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:32,120
Oh my God, that's so cool.Cool. Oh, so cool. It's like really cool.

40
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,864
You're so cool - I'm not that cool.

41
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:36,506
What? Cool! Oh, your face is so cool.

42
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:39,144
What! Oh my God! Ha, ha, ha.

43
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:40,195
Something like that.

44
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:44,338
What are some pick up lines that 60% of the time, work every time?

45
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:47,684
OK, now, very good question, and I'm going to give you

46
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:53,271
one of the most important pieces of advice I can possibly give a guy trying to date women.

47
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:56,659
Women are crazy and we want what we can't have.

48
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,082
So what you have to do is: flirt, flirt, flirt

49
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:06,110
till they're into it and then pretend you're not into them anymore.

50
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,412
Hhhh... oh my God, cause here's what we're thinking in our head. Ready? Get ready.

51
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:14,541
This guy is really cute, I'm really excited meeting him, oh my gosh, I think I like him

52
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:16,141
but you know what - there's other guys here, so...

53
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:20,204
What?! He's not paying attention, why isn't he paying attention?

54
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:22,300
What's wrong with me? There's must be something wrong with me.

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
He's looking at other girls, he's looking at other girls.

56
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,485
Those other girls look at him.

57
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,362
No, *** other girls. I want him.

58
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:29,013
I love him. I'm in love with him. I want him forever.

59
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:31,395
I wanna babysit him. I love what's-his-name and I want him.

60
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:32,406
I want him... No!!!

61
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,953
That's what we're thinking, Okay?

62
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:36,809
Yeah, I'd like to know how to plan an orgy.

63
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:41,595
Great question. I suggest using E-vite, it's a nice way to

64
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:46,434
personalize an invitation and send them out to a group of people.

65
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,441
How to tell your parent(s) you're pregnant?

66
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,041
OK, great question, what you need to do is

67
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:54,367
sit your parents down and tell them flat out that you murdered someone - by accident.

68
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,694
and then when they get hysterical, you say:

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,758
"Psych! Parents! I, actually - I created someone."

70
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:04,390
They're gonna be a lot happier.

71
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,698
Alright everyone, that's it for the first episode of Daily Gradvice.

72
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,880
Please follow me on Tumblr so you'll know

73
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,192
when I'm about to do a Daily Gradvice video.

74
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:15,607
And you'll be able to submit your questions.

75
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:21,428
Because... can't have answers unless there's questions,so...

76
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:25,541
Bye!

77
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,738
How do you tell if someone is a girl?

78
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:35,965
Great question. You need to ask them: "Do you like the Bravo Channel?"

79
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:38,156
And that'll narrow it down.

80
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:41,573
No, wait! That won't.
