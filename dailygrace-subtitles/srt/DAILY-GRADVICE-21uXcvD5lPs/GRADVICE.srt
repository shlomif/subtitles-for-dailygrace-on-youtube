1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
What's up, fuckers?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,300
Hey guys, it's Friday here on dailygrace and you know what that means?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Sex advice, sex advice, sexy advice

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,600
OK, now I've decided that one Friday of every month

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,600
is going to be dedicated to advice

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
on love, sex, relationships

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,600
and the etc. that falls in that umbrella of

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
weather cat things (?)

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,300
and we're going call this "Daily Gradvice".

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,300
I went on my Tumblr and I asked you guys what kind of advice

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,500
did you need about love and sex and relationships

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,500
and you all gave me some interesting questions

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,600
so - let's get into them.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,200
what's the best way to approach a girl or a guy?

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,900
Great question.

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,800
From the front.

17
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:07,526
How do I tell a guy I made out with several times, that I would be a terrible girlfriend and don't think we should go out... help!

18
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:09,466
OK, interesting question.

19
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:13,918
First, you need to tell him that you're using him to play mouth paintball.

20
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:21,823
And then you just have to say "I really don't want to change my Facebook status."
